# LiteViewer
A Couchbase Lite 2.0 utility for viewing the contents of a database.  It supports querying of a Couchbase Lite database using the C# Couchbase Lite query syntax.  It is based on DB019 of Couchbase Lite .NET 2.0.

# Limitations
Currently, this program only runs via WPF.  Once Roslyn scripting support matures a bit more on other platforms their support can be reevaluated.  Encrypted databases cannot currently be viewed either.
